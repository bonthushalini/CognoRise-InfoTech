##Project Title: Machine Learning Tasks - House Price Prediction, Spam Email Detection, Diabetes Prediction

1.Overview:
This project encompasses three distinct tasks that apply machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems. The tasks include:
House Price Prediction: Estimating house prices based on various features.
Spam Email Detection: Classifying emails as spam or ham.
Diabetes Prediction: Predicting the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on health metrics.

##House Price Prediction
Description
This task involves building a model to predict house prices based on features like location, size, and other relevant factors. The goal is to accurately estimate the market value of houses.
Approach
Data Preprocessing
Feature Selection
Model Training (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest)
Model Evaluation
Results
The model achieved a satisfactory level of accuracy in predicting house prices.

##Spam Email Detection
Description
In this task, the objective is to classify emails as spam or non-spam (ham). The dataset includes labeled emails, and the goal is to develop a model that can automatically identify spam emails.
Approach
Text Preprocessing 
Feature Extraction 
Model Training (e.g., Logistic Regression,Random Forest)
Model Evaluation
Results
The model demonstrated high accuracy in distinguishing between spam and ham emails.

##Diabetes Prediction
Description
This task focuses on predicting whether an individual has diabetes based on features like age, BMI, and blood glucose levels. The goal is to build a reliable predictive model.
Approach
Data Preprocessing
Feature Selection
Model Training (e.g., Random Forest, Decision Tree)
Model Evaluation
Results
The model successfully predicted the likelihood of diabetes with a strong performance.
